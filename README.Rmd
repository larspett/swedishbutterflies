`swedishbutterflies` is an R package for SeBMS - the Swedish Butterfly Monitoring Scheme - offering tools for accessing data, making plots and a Shiny app.

## Installing from github

If you want to install the latest version:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
# First make sure you have the devtools package
# which simplifies installations from github
# Note: Windows users have to first install Rtools to use devtools

install.packages("devtools") 
library(devtools)
install_github("rekonstrukt/swedishbutterflies")

# A specific versioned release can be installed like this:
install_github("rekonstrukt/swedishbutterflies@0.1.6")

```

## Quick start

Since the package can read data from a Postgres db with live data from SeBMS, some initial system configuration may first be needed to set up the connection.

### Secure shell connection to the database server

If the database connection requires an ssh tunnel to first be established, and you are using a *nix system, this configuration can be achieved by editing `~/.ssh/config`, adding a section such as:

```bash
Host butterflies
    User my_ssh_user
    HostName my_server_ip_for_the_postgres_db_server
    LocalForward 5432 127.0.0.1:5432
    ServerAliveInterval 30

```

After this, the tunnel can be established with the command `ssh -N butterflies`. Upon success, the database can then be reached locally at the postgres db standard port. Similar results can be achieved using `putty` on Windows platforms.

### Config for db connection

Once the database server is available, the R package needs to be configured to use the database connection. To achieve this, load the package in your R environment and create a `config.yml` with the db connection details and perhaps also a `.Renviron` file, if you have a config file that references environment variables in R:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

library(swedishbutterflies)
library(rappdirs)

# this is the location for config.yml holding db connection details
app_dir("sebms")$config() 
# the location may vary depending on OS
# on a Linux OS a valid path for the file is $HOME/.config/sebms/config.yml
# on a Windows 8 OS a valid path for the file is C:\Users\IEUser\AppData\Local\sebms\sebms\config.yml

# this is the location for .Renviron
Sys.getenv("R_USER")
# on a Linux OS a valid path for the .Renviron file is $HOME ie ~/.Renviron
# on a Windows 8 OS a valid path for the .Renviron file is C:\Users\IEUser\.Renviron
# on a Windows 10 OS a valid path for the .Renviron file is C:\Users\IEUser\Documents\.Renviron

```

Example content that can be used in the `config.yml`:

```bash
default:
  sebms:
    driver: !expr RPostgres::Postgres() 
    server: 'localhost'
    uid: 'my_db_username'
    pwd: 'my_db_password'
    port: 5432
    database: 'test4'
```
If you prefer to use environment variables for the credentials and reference those in the `config.yml`, the file can look like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# example content in config.yml
content <- readLines(system.file("extdata", "config.yml", 
  package = "swedishbutterflies"))

cat(paste(content, collapse = "\n"))
```

For the above connection to be initiated, you also need to set up your `.Renviron` with the environment variables containing the credentials:

```console
DBUSER = my_db_username
DBPASS = my_db_password

```

## Usage

After getting connected to the database, look at usage examples to get you started. 

Please read the Vignette, using either the Help tab in RStudio IDE or the R prompt command `browseVignettes(package = "swedishbutterflies")`.

## Development

To further develop or change the package, please refer to instructions at <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/>, then fork this repo and submit a PR with the changes. 

For a concrete example - to make a change with regards to how the filtering on species and year dimensions works for the species data, edit the 'R/data.R' file for example by adjusting the query used in the sebms_species_per_year function, and possibly adding a test in `test/testthat/test-sebms-various.R` that verifies expected results, then do the Ctrl+Shift+{D,T,E} steps and then use git to commit and push the changes.

To change functions that retrieve data from the db, please make changes primarily in the `R/data.R` file.

The plotting uses ggplot2 and leaflet mostly and functions are in `R/plot.R` and `R/zgeomaps.R` for the spatial data.

The long-form documentation / Vignette is located in `vignettes/sebms-intro.Rmd`.
